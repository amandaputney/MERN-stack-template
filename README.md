# MERN-Stack

Template for future MERN-Stack projects

## How-to

Here’s the process to create a new MERN-Stack project that starts with the infrastructure code:

### 1. Clone Repo

Clone the mern-infrastructure repo: git clone url of mern-infrastructure name-of-project
Note that the folder created will be same as name-of-project instead of mern-infrastructure

cd name-of-project

### 2. Install the Node modules:

npm i

### 3. Create a .env (touch .env) and add entries for DATABASE_URL and SECRET

### 4. Update Project Name

Update the "name" : "mern-infrastructure" in package.json to the name of your project.

### 5. Create a new repo on your personal GH account.

Copy the new GH repo’s URL.

### 6. Update the remote’s URL

git remote set-url origin paste the copied GH url

### 7. Make the initial commit

git add -A && git commit -m "Initial commit"

### 8. Push for the first time

git push -u origin main

### 9. Have fun!
